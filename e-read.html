    By R/NeonTempo

    Intro
    Has anyone heard of the Left/Right Game?
    A few points before we start.
    Firstly, I am not the protagonist of this story. 
    I just went to university with her, and though she went on to become a professional writer,
    I most certainly did not. She'll be taking over from me further down but, until then,
    please forgive my slightly awkward delivery while I give you guys the necessary context.
    Secondly, I don't know what you will make of the following events,
    and I'm sure many of you might consider it all some sort of hoax.
    I wasn't present for any of what transpired in Phoenix, Arizona but 
    I can vouch for the person who wrote the following logs. She is not, 
    and has never been, a fantasist.

    Ok so I once knew a girl called Alice Sharma. She was an undergrad at Edinburgh Uni the same time I was. 
    My educational poison was History, a degree which has greatly benefited my career as a bicycle repairman.
    Alice Sharma studied journalism, though perhaps "studied" isn't the word.
    It's not an exaggeration to say that she lived and breathed the subject.
    Editor-in-chief of the campus paper, recognisable voice of student radio. 
    She was frustratingly tunnel visioned, and she was a journalist in her own right before anyone gave her a professional shot.
    We met in student halls and became friends almost immediately. 
    A meandering waster trying to stay off his parent's farm and an intrepid, 
    ambitious reporter may not seem the most obvious pairing, but I learned not to question it.
    She was inspiring, and smart and she proofread all my essays. I’m not too sure what she saw in me.
    We were eventually flatmates down in London where she chased her dream and I chased my tail. 
    She got a few jobs here and there, but nothing befitting of her skills. 
    After months of fruitless internships and rejections, Alice called a flat meeting, 
    telling us that she was moving to America, accepting a position chasing stories for National Public Radio.
    The job had come out of the blue, the result of a hail mary application she thought had been dismissed out of hand.
    We threw her a bittersweet going away party and put the room up for rent.
    That party was the last time I saw Alice Sharma. She dropped out of contact a few months after her departure. 
    Complete radio silence. I assumed she was just busy so I carried on with my small but happy life, 
    and waited for her to pop up on television with some important words below her name; 
    Chief Correspondent, Senior Analyst… something like that.
    The radio silence was broken last week, and, for reasons you’ll glean further down, 
    I’m less happy about it than I would’ve thought.

    Arriving home from work I found a lone email in my otherwise bare inbox.
    An email that would later be described as "suspicious" by my tech literate friends.
    Despite being born in the early 1990's I didn't own a computer until uni,
    and I've missed several important lessons in the world of cyberspace. 
    Lessons like "Don't call it Cyberspace" of course and more importantly, 
    "Don't open emails with no text, no subject and no sender's address."
    I realise most of you would have deleted this anonymous, blank email immediately, 
    my friends certainly would have, but beyond my basic ignorance about online safety, 
    something further compelled me to open it. The only thing of substance in the entire message was a zipped folder, labeled:
    Left.Right.AS

    I don't have to explain what I was hoping those final initials stood for.
    Opening the zipped folder I found myself staring at a stack of text files. 
    Each one titled with a date, continuing sequentially from the very earliest file "07-02-2017". 
    (To any Americans in the room this is the 7th of February).
    I’ve since read the files a few times, and shown them to some friends. 
    They don't know what to make of it either, but they certainly aren't as concerned as me.
    They think Alice is just in a creative writing phase and, if I didn't know her, I’d have to agree. 
    But the thing is, I do know her. Alice Sharma only cares about the truth and if that's the case with these files, 
    insane as it may sound, then it’s very possible my friend has documented her own disappearance.
    The people who suggested this forum said you discuss strange occurrences etc. 

    If you guys have come across anything to do with the below, or know any of the people involved, 
    then please send any information my way.
    Has anyone here heard of the Left/Right Game?

07/02/2017

They say great stories happen to those who can tell them. 
Robert J. Guthard is an exception to that rule. As I sit at his table, 
sip his coffee and listen to him recount the past 65 years it sounds like he's reading off a shopping list. 
Every event, his first job, his second wedding, his third divorce, none of them receive more than one or two sentences.
Rob plows through the years, the curt, dispassionate curator of his own personal history. 
Yet the story itself is so fascinating, so rich with moments and so wildly meandering that it somehow stands on its own merits.
It's a great story, no matter how you tell it.
By the time Rob was 21, he'd gotten married, had a son, worked as a farmer, a mover, a boat engineer,
and grown estranged from his spouse... Here's him talking about that.

ROB: Course my wife started to get dissatisfied, I was away a while.
AS: For work?
**ROB:**Vietnam.
AS: You were in Vietnam? How was that for you?
ROB: I ain't never been back since.
That was everything he had to say concerning his first divorce, and the entire Vietnam war.
Rob had four marriages after that, and even more professions.
 After the war he worked with a firm of private detectives, got shot at once by the mob, 
 then he became a courier, which is how a poor boy from Alabama got to see the world.
ROB: I been to most of the continents with that job. I been to India. You from India?
AS: My mum and dad are from India yeah.
ROB: See I could tell.
He'd been arrested once in Singapore, after one of his packages had been found to be full of white powder. 
He spent three days locked up before someone got around to checking the substance. It was chalk.
A friend he made during his brief custody, Hiroji Sato, invited Rob to stay with him in Japan. 
Just getting over the breakup of his third marriage, Rob took the offer. He stayed in Japan for another 5 years.
ROB: The Japanese are good people. Good manners.
But they got all these urban legends and ghost stories that Hiroji was crazy for,
spent all his free time chasing them down. Like, you heard of Jorogumo?
AS: I don't think so"
ROB: Well she's this spider lady lives in the Joro Falls round Izu.
Meant to be real pretty but real dangerous. Hiroji took us out there to get a picture of her.
AS: Did you ever meet Jorogumo?
ROB Nah she didn't show. None of them did.
I didn't believe at all until we went to Aokigahara
Aokigahara, affectionately titled the Suicide Forest. 
The next stop on Rob's adventure. It's an area of woodland at the base of Mount Fuji,
a notorious hotspot for young people looking to take their own lives. Hiroji, 
Rob's ghost obsessed jailmate turned best friend, 
took him to Aokigahara to chase "yurei" the ghosts of the forest.
AS: Did you find anything? In Aokigahara?
ROB: Well I ain't gonna ask you to believe me. But I was a PI. Professional cynic. 
Even I can't deny there was a spirit in those woods.
From that moment on, Rob's sentences start getting longer. 
A childlike excitement creeps into his voice. 
I get the distinct feeling we're moving beyond background, 
beyond Rob Guthard's old life, and towards his new one. 
The one he wants to talk about. The one that led him to contact the show.
ROB: It walked up to me through the trees.
Looked like static you see on a TV screen but it had a human shape almost.
AS: Almost?
ROB: It was missing an arm. It reached out to me but I bolted outta that forest so fast. 
Hiroji never saw it, holds it against me to this day.
Hiroji had good reason to be annoyed. 
Rob says that Mr Sato had been going to the forest 2-3 times per year for three decades. 
To have a rookie come along and claim to have seen a yurei on his first trip? 
I'd be more than a little cranky.
But Rob didn't stay a rookie for long. 
In fact, it was in those woods that he discovered his current passion. 
The supernatural, or more accurately, the documentation and investigation of urban legends.
Legends like Bloody Mary, the Jersey Devil, Sasquatch. Rob has looked into them all.
ROB: I figured if one was true then who knows how many others could be.
AS: How many have you proven so far?
ROB: Since Aokigahara? Ain't none of em had any proof to em. Except for one. 
That's why I called you guys up.
At this point, Rob can’t hope to repress his smile.
The Left/Right game appeared on a paranormal message board in June 2016. 
Only a few people frequently visited the forum and, of these regulars, 
only Rob took an interest in the post.
ROB: The whole thing had a level of detail you don't see in other stories.
AS: What details grabbed your interest?
ROB: Logs. High quality pictures. The guy documented everything, 
said he wasn't gonna play the game anymore. I think he wanted somebody to keep investigating.
AS: And you were that somebody.
ROB: That's right. I set about trying to verify his information right away.
AS: And how did it go?
ROB: Well... It didn't take long to realise the Left/Right Game is the real thing.
The rules of the Left/Right game are simple. Get in your car and take a drive. 
Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. 
Repeat the process ad infinitum, until you wind up somewhere... new. The rules are easy to understand, 
but Rob says their not so easy to follow.
ROB: There ain't all that many roads where you can turn left and right and left and right and keep going. 
Most of the time you find yourself at a dead end or needing to turn in the wrong direction. 
Phoenix is built on a grid system so you can keep going left and right as long as you need to.
AS: Did you move to Phoenix for the Left/Right game?
ROB: That's right.
I try not to seem incredulous. Selling your house in another state, 
packing up and moving your whole life to Phoenix, Arizona just to play a game you saw on the internet? 
It seems like insanity. Rob smiles as he reads my expression. 
I can clearly read his expression too. "You'll see." It says. "Just wait."
I wouldn't have to wait long. 
Included within the 9 page submission Rob sent our show, was a long list of suggested items the chosen reporter should bring with them. 
Clothes for three days, a pocket knife, matches, bandages. 
There were also a set of qualifications the reporter should have. 
The ability to drive, basic vehicle maintenance and its human equivalent... first aid training. 
He didn't just want to talk about the Left/Right Game. He wanted to take one of us along.
Rob leaves a short while later to embark on a few errands, "Prepping the Run", as he calls it. 
He shows me to the guest room and we part ways, on good terms but very much aware of the other's poorly veiled opinions. 
He knew I saw him as a charming obsessive, chasing after a fairy tale. He saw me as a naive cynic, on the cusp of a new world. 
All I could think as I heard the front door close is that by tomorrow afternoon, one of us would be right.
More after this.
When I wake up the next morning, Rob is in my room, holding a tray which he'd knocked on the bottom of to rouse me. 
I don't manage to record the start of our conversation.
ROB: - I got bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup. We got some more downstairs but I wanted you to wake up to something good. 
We won't be eatin' this stuff on the road."
Rob has made me waffles. He sets them down on the night stand and talks through the coming day as I eat. 
I'll admit it feels a little uncomfortable, waking up in a stranger's home to find said stranger already standing over me, 
but I quickly move past it. I tell myself that he’s an older man, accustomed to living alone in his own house, 
not usually having to think about boundaries. Anyway, he certainly knows his way around a waffle iron.
ROB: We hit the road at 9. I wanted to give you time to get ready before everyone shows up.
AS: There are other people coming?
ROB: We got a 5 car convoy on the road today. They'll be here in an hour.
This is the first I’ve heard of a convoy, and to be honest I’m surprised. 
The game is Rob's obsession, and I’m here at his request. 
The idea that anyone else would have an interest in today's drive is a little perplexing.
Half an hour later, sated, showered and dressed in the "functional clothing" Rob had so painstakingly outlined, I
take my pack out to the porch. Rob’s already there, waiting for his associates to show up.
AS: I thought you'd be conducting a few more errands.
ROB: If you ain't prepared by the morning of, you ain't prepared.
AS: Hah ok I guess that's fair. Oh, Rob is the garage locked? 
The inside door won't budge and I wanted to mic up the car.
ROB: Yeah it's locked up I'll open it for ya.
AS: Thank you.
ROB: In fact it's about time I wheeled her out. Fair warning Ms Sharma, 
she's a thing of beauty.
To Rob Guthard, beauty took the form of a dark green Jeep Wrangler. 
Rob climbs in and lets it roll out of the garage, where it dominates every inch of driveway. 
The car is large; four doors with a roof enclosing the entire compartment. 
It’s also been modified extensively, yet another example of Rob's dedication to the game.
ROB: What're you thinking?
AS: I think you're two caterpillar treads short of driving a tank.
ROB: Hah yeah I fixed her up good. I put the winch in, heavy duty tires, 
the light rig on top is LED's. They'll make midnight look like noon but they don't use hardly any power.
AS: Aren't Jeeps open top usually?
ROB: Not all. This is the Unlimited. I like to have a covered car when I head on the road.
I climb in and stow my pack. Rob had removed the back seats to afford more storage space. 
The place is packed to the brim. Jerry cans of gasoline, barrels of water, rope, 
snacks and his own neatly packed set of clothes.
I wonder if the rest of our convoy would take the game so seriously.
ROB: We got Apollo coming up in 10 minutes. No one else has given me a time. 
I sent the schedule weeks ago, this always happens.
AS: His name's Apollo?
ROB: That's his call sign. Apollo Creed I think he said.
AS: Why are you using call signs?
ROB: Did I not tell you? Oh yeah we're gonna use call signs on the road, 
keep communication clear.
AS: What's your callsign?
ROB: Ferryman.
AS: ... What's my call sign?
ROB: I thought about it. I was thinking London, you're from London right?
AS: I'm from Bristol.
ROB: Bristol? That’s fine I guess.
It’s less than ten minutes before Apollo turns the corner.
Rob jumps out of his chair and paces briskly over to the edge of his property, 
as his first guest pulls up and steps onto the sidewalk.
Apollo vaguely resembles his namesake,
dark skinned, tall and noticeably well built, though it’s clear he couldn’t be less of a fighter. 
This Apollo Creed is all smiles and seems to have a penchant for laughing at his own jokes.
AS: How far have you come?
APOLLO: I've come out of Chicago. Took three days hard driving.
AS: And you know Rob from the forums?
APOLLO: Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha
Rob walks over to Apollo's car, gesturing him over to talk shop. 
Rob’s clearly impressed with Apollo's choice of vehicle, a blue Range Rover packed to the ceiling with kit. 
I was more impressed with Rob himself. 
Somehow this 65 year old farmer's son had become respected in a vast online community. 
My dad is Rob’s age and he's just discovered copy and paste.
The rest don't take long to arrive. 
Two Minnesotan librarians, also around Rob's age, pull up in a grey Ford Focus. 
They’re brother and sister, and they've shared ghost hunting as a hobby their entire lives. 
I find it hard to suppress a smile when they meekly introduce themselves as Bonnie and Clyde.
CLYDE: We would have gotten here sooner we had to drop by to get some blankets. 
Pleasure to meet you ma'am.
AS: Pleasure to meet you too.
CLYDE: Would you be the journalist?
AS: That's right.
CLYDE: You used to write for the town paper didn't you?
He's talking to his sister there, she nods. Clyde is clearly the spokesperson for the pair, yet they both seem incredibly shy. 
Whether they admire the famous outlaws, or just the name, it's pretty clear they couldn't be more different from the real thing.
Next to show up are Lilith and Eve, English Lit students at New York University and proprietors of the YouTube channel Paranormicon. 
Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith and Eve have no issue holding a conversation. As soon as they learn who I am, and what I do for a living, 
they attempt to conscript me for an expedition to Roswell.
LILITH: We have a friend there, he's been seeing some-
EVE: -He's a seismologist
LILITH: Yeah and he's been recording readings over the years that show subterranean movement. 
Predictable movement.
EVE: We're going to see him in July, but we could work it around you if you're free.
AS: I'll have to check my schedule
EVE: OK cool let me give you my email...
They quickly hurry off to film an intro for their latest video, featuring a quick interview with Rob, 
who seems pretty welcoming of the attention.
The last two cars arrive within a few seconds of each other. 
A lithe, strong willed older lady who goes by Bluejay and a younger man going by the callsign “Ace”. 
Bluejay has arrived in a grey Ford Explorer. Ace, much to Rob's annoyance, has arrived in a Porsche.
ROB: Did you think that's gonna help on the road? I didn't write that-
ACE: It's my car. What am I meant to do,? It's my car.
ROB: You didn't read my itinerary, you got nothing packed in there.
ACE: I did read it sir OK? Calm down. I have a bag, I won't ask you for anything.
ROB: Well I know that's true.
Ace and Rob were off to a bad start. Ace takes a phone call, and despite my best efforts to get an interview with Bluejay, 
she doesn't seem interested in talking to a journalist.
With five cars, and seven travellers waiting for a green light, Rob hands out radios and charging packs, 
then launches into a quick safety briefing. Wear seatbelts. Stay in position. 
Communicate clearly and often. It’s at this moment I start to feel a little dismay. 
I like Rob, and clearly so does everyone else. He'd convinced all of them to drive across the country to join in with his game. 
I start to worry what will happen in the likely event that the whole thing isn’t real. Would Rob lose the respect of his peers?
Would he accept failure when it comes? After seeing the effort he’s put into these runs, 
the next few hours have the potential to be wildly uncomfortable.
With a smile and a few encouraging words, Rob ends his briefing and beckons me over to the Wrangler. 
I clamber inside and make myself as comfortable as possible.
ROB: You ready for this Bristol?
AS: I'm ready.
ROB: Ok then let's hit the road.
The Wrangler pulls out of the driveway, and the convoy follows in order of arrival. 
Apollo, Bonnie & Clyde, Lilith & Eve, Bluejay and Ace keep a steady pace behind us as we come up to the first corner.
Rob slowly and deliberately turns left, checking on the others in his rear view mirror. 
He looks back to the road as Ace’s Porsche completes the first turn of the game. 
Shortly afterwards, Apollo checks in on the CB radio.
APOLLO: This is Apollo for Ferryman. How many to more go Rob? ahahaha
ROB: Hah as many as it takes.
I can tell Rob wanted the to reserve the radio for something other than Apollo's quips. 
But he seems to like Apollo enough to let it slide. I'm not sure Ace would have received the same treatment. 
We take the next right, then another left. Now safely assured that everyone's following correctly, 
Rob speaks my thoughts aloud.
ROB: You're wondering the same thing Apollo is.
AS: What do you mean?
ROB: You're wondering how many turns we're gonna take before we hit some wall or something. 
Before you find out this is all just a story.
AS: Does that disappoint you?
ROB: I'd be disappointed if you weren't thinking something like it. 
But now we're on the road I gotta say something and you gotta listen to it.
AS: OK...
ROB: We're coming up to a tunnel soon. Any time before we reach it you can get out, 
walk in any direction you like, and you won’t be in the game no more. Once we go through, 
you gotta retrace the route we took to get yourself back out that tunnel. That's when you’re home. 
And you gotta convince someone to take you back in a car coz I ain't ferrying you back 20 minutes in. 
You got till the tunnel to skip out on this, understand?
AS: I understand. Though I have to say I'm getting little nervous.
ROB: Ain't nothing wrong with a little nervous.
We've taken 23 turns by this point. Already I feel like we're traversing the city pretty effectively. 
Rob's heavily modified Wrangler solicits a few impressed glances from passersby, 
as well as several honks of respect from other Jeep drivers. 
Other than those few moments, everything seems completely indistinguishable from a regular morning drive. 
I even start to worry if there’ll be anything at all for this story. 
“Reporter Takes Drive With Interesting Man” isn’t exactly Pulitzer worthy.
Turn 33 leads us onto a short, unassuming street. A row of small businesses in a quiet Phoenician neighbourhood; 
liquor, second hand clothing, tools and, at the end of the street, a little shop selling antique mirrors. 
Ten or so people shuffle along the sidewalk, smiling, talking, planning their weekends. 
The only lone person is a young woman in a grey coat..
I briefly glimpse her at the end of the street, standing on our next corner, the back of her coat reflected in fifty old mirrors. 
Even from a distance I can see that she’s sullen, wide eyed and nervous. She shifts constantly on her feet, tugging at the button of her coat.
I look away to write some notes as we roll down the street. When I look up again, the woman is standing by my window, staring right at me. 
She’s smiling, a wide, unfaltering grin that seems almost offensive in its complete insincerity.
GREYWOMAN: Lambs at the gate. Hoping for something better than clover when all they find are things worse than slaughter.
AS: Rob what's happening?
ROB: Ignore her.
GREYWOMAN: He wanted to leave me so I cut him out. The lake was hungry it drank the wound clean.
AS: Miss, are you alright?
The smile vanishes, it snaps from her face and suddenly, the woman is furious.
GREYWOMAN: What do you think you're doing?! Have you gone mad?!
I reflexively press myself back in my chair as the woman, wild eyed and gaunt, slams her fists against my window, 
with every intent of breaking through.
GREYWOMAN: Would you dance down the lion’s tongue? It will shred you, you whore! 
It will shred you down to your sins! You fucking bastard!
Rob puts his foot down, and the Wrangler rolls defiantly away from the woman. 
As we turn the corner I watch her as she wretches, her every movement cradled in abject hysteria. 
he yells despairingly at the rest of the convoy, bursting into tears when the last car passes her by.
As she shrinks into the rear view mirror, I see her turn to a large mirror on the side of the shop, 
which the owner is in the process of polishing. I watch as she walks up to it, and with a convulsant scream, slams her head into the glass.
The mirror cracks around her forehead, the owner jumps back in shock, and as the woman pulls her head from the mirror's surface, 
the fractured spider’s web is dripping red. It all happens in a split second, and she quickly swerves from my view as we take the next left.
AS: Rob, what was that?
ROB: She's there sometimes.
AS: On that street?
ROB: On the 34th turn.
AS: Who is she?
ROB: I don't know. She's never acted out that much before though. Must be a special trip.
I find Rob's lack of concern a little unpleasant, and his implication that this woman's 
ravings were the symptom of an internet game leaves me more than a little perturbed. 
As I see it, there are a few explanations for what just happened, and none of them lead to a comforting conclusion.
If we had just encountered a bonafide crazy person, then one could argue that Rob is just seeing what he wants to see. 
Maybe he'd bought into the game’s story so much that every strange but explainable occurrence would be rationalised as 
the next step in his favourite paranormal narrative.
Alternatively, the woman could have been an actor, a more elaborate theory sure, 
but not unheard of. People have lied to the show before and Rob was receiving a tonne of publicity for this attempt from Lilith, 
Eve and I. I admit, Rob didn't seem like a liar, but good liars never do.
There is a third alternative however. An alternative which, if you put logic aside, 
explains the all troubling little details that I couldn't help but notice. Because as strange as the grey woman was, 
isn't it stranger that no one on the street would react? I couldn't recall a single glance in her direction by anybody on the sidewalk. 
Perhaps that theory falls apart when you consider the shock on the mirror seller's face but, when I think about it, 
he only reacted once the mirror shattered, and even then, I feel like his attention was on the mirror itself.
The radio crackles.
LILITH: Lillith to Bristol. Sara... Eve got that on camera! Do you have audio?
AS: I think it picked her up.
LILITH: My god that was so weird. Can you send us the file when we stop? Can you ask Ferryman when we're stopping?
AS: When's our stopping point?
ROB: For them, in about 30 minutes. For you? Well, you tell me.
Rob turns off a busy street just before a large intersection, onto a much quieter stretch of two lane road. 
Ahead of us the road slopes downward, leading into an underpass, which disappears into darkness.
We'd arrived at the tunnel.
AS: What is this supposed to pass under?
ROB: Ain't supposed to pass under anything, it's just there.
AS: And if we weren't playing the game?
ROB: Then it won't show. The question is, are you playing the game or not?
Rob turns to me. It’s the first time he’s taken his eyes off the road since we started. 
He pulls the car to a slow stop at the mouth of the tunnel.
ROB: You get out now you can go wherever you wanna go, but through there you'll need a car to get yourself home and, 
like I said, mine ain't turnin round for a long while. You understand?
It’s a dramatic statement, but unsettlingly, it doesn’t feel like he’s attempting to dramatise. 
It feels like I’m having something genuinely asked of me. Am I ready for what’s to come? Do I accept the risks involved? 
Do I consent to be taken down this road, and the next road, and the next? Am I prepared to see this game through, real or otherwise, to its end?
AS: What are you waiting for?
Rob smiles, and turns back to the road. He picks up the CB radio holds down the button on the side. The microphone crackles.
ROB: This is Ferryman to all cars. Anyone want to step out then pull to the side now. Otherwise, stay in formation and have some supplies at hand. 
We got a long ways to go.
Much like the game I’m so tentatively playing, my view of Robert J. Guthard seems to change direction frequently. 
I’d heard all about his life, but I’m sure that I know him. I like the guy, but I’m not certain that I trust him. 
And though I admire his dedication to the Left/Right Game, I’m not sure I’ll like where it might lead us. 
Yet as he takes us into the tunnel, his face vanishing and reappearing under the dim sodium lights, 
I can that tell he expects this trip to be a major step in his already impressive story, and this time, for better or for worse, 
I’m along for the ride.

Hi everyone.
I’ve got the day off work and I wanted to start it by posting up the next log. I also want to thank you all for your responses so far.
A few people have linked me to sites that Rob J. Guthard may have operated on. Someone even offered to look for the mirror shop in Phoenix and try to retrace the route to Rob’s neighbourhood. I’m going to spend the day making a few international calls, and sending emails out but if you guys have any other ideas about how I could pursue this I’d really appreciate them.
In all honesty, I’m going to need all the help I can get. This whole ordeal has proven pretty categorically that I am no Alice Sharma.
Speaking of which, I’m going to let her take it from here.
Thanks again.




08/02/2017
The next turn comes immediately after the tunnel.
We’d been in the dimly lit passage for almost two minutes, but at the pace Rob likes to travel it’s hard to figure out how far we’ve actually gone. When we descended into the underpass we were just nearing the outskirts of Phoenix. Scrutinising the rear view mirror as we leave, it’s fair to say we aren’t that much further out. Everything else; the temperature, the time of day, the weather, all seems exactly like it had been before we ventured into the tunnel. I’m not sure what I was expecting of course, but it certainly doesn’t feel like we’re anywhere new.
The tunnel itself had been similarly underwhelming, especially considering the importance Rob seemed to place on it. In fact the only thing of true interest since we passed through was something Rob said once we hit the halfway mark. As the tunnel’s mouth loomed towards us, Rob picked up the CB Radio transceiver, and issued a casual warning to the convoy. The message itself was straightforward, his choice of words however was… curious.
I decided to ask him about it.
AS: Rob, just a second ago, when you told us the next turn was coming up. Why did you use the word “trap”?
ROB: Hmm?
AS: I have it in my notes. You said, “Folks we’re coming to the end soon, first little trap’s coming up. Our next turn is sharp left as we leave. Look out for it.” Is there a reason you used the word “trap”?
ROB: Just one of those things. Fella who wrote all the original logs, he liked to think the road would try and trick you into making a wrong turn. Small roads off large highways, roads obscured from view, sharp turns like this one.
AS: He thought the road was trying to deceive him?
ROB: Yeah pretty much. I gotta say I agree with the guy.
By this point, we’ve taken the offending corner and the next right a little further on. I can’t help but feel that Rob is reading a great deal into what is, essentially, an abrupt turn in an ordinary road. The level of conspiracy he’s able to place behind such a simple thing, going as far as to ascribe some mischievous quality to the asphalt itself… it’s hard to take seriously.
In fact, I’m starting to wonder less about whether Rob can convince me this game is real, and more about whether I’d ever be able to convince him that it isn’t. Perhaps this story will be less about where a magic roadway goes after a few zigzagging turns, and more about where the human mind can go if it invests too heavily in an idea. To his credit Rob has noted my cynicism, he even seems to welcome it, but if our current surroundings are supposed to convince me, then he’s going to find me more cynical than he anticipated.
Rob keeps his hands on the wheel and his eyes on the road. Any attempt at an interview receives a pleasant but curt response. He’s not being evasive, his attention is just elsewhere. Before I know it, half an hour has gone by without Rob speaking a word. It seems like a large part of the Left/Right Game involves driving in complete silence. Once again, I’m not sure what I expected, but it’s certainly not been an earth shattering start.
At least it gives me time to type up my notes.
ROB: Ferryman to all cars. We stop here.
An uneventful hour and a half has passed since we left the tunnel. I didn’t notice Rob pick up the receiver, but before I know it the Wrangler has pulled up at the side of the road, leaving a large space behind us for the rest of the convoy to park up. The buildings are getting few and far between now, it won’t be long until we were in the desert proper. With this in mind, I assume Rob is simply stopping to let everyone drink up.
I probably shouldn’t assume when it comes to Rob Guthard.
Though this is definitely a rest stop, Rob also has some important words for the crew. He gathers us round in a rough semicircle, talking while we eat our provisions.
ROB: Now, I mentioned in the emails that, at certain points on this trip, you’d need to do some things just because I say so. This is one of those times. Ya’ll understand?
EVE: Uh yeah I… I guess... we get to know what it is right?
APOLLO: This is when he tells us to give him our money right Rob? Ahah
ACE: Yeah I’d rather know what’s going on.
ROB: And I don't intend on keeping anything from you. I just want to be clear, that across this next stretch you need to follow my orders to the letter.
ACE: Yeah we get it, just tell us already.
Rob takes a few moments, perhaps to lend gravity to his point, perhaps to swallow some barbed words intended for the increasingly impatient Ace. When he does speak, it’s in a measured and serious tone. He’s clearly adamant that we take his words onboard.
ROB: For about half an hour, the next 13 turns, we’ll be going one by one. We travel in order of formation. Me and Bristol will go first, then I’ll radio the next car to follow. When you reach the jeep, you park up behind me. Then we keep going as normal, now…
Rob takes a deep breath in. When he starts up again, his speech is even more pointed than before.
ROB: … there’s a hitchhiker on the road, a well dressed man with a case. You pick him up, you take him where he needs to go. You do NOT under ANY circumstances, talk to the man. To be safe, don’t look at him. Don’t take anything he offers you. Don’t open the door for him or wave goodbye when he leaves. You do not acknowledge him, in any way. You want my advice, don’t say a word till you get to the stopping point.
LILITH: Why do we have to go one by one?
**ROB:”” Guy who wrote all the logs says he don’t like choosing cars. I don’t know what that means, but I’m lucky I never had to find out.
ACE: Why don't we just not pick him up?
ROB: That isn’t an option.
ACE: Well, I mean, yes it is. I don’t see why we...
ROB: Goddamn it, you’ll pick him up, whether you want to or not!
The group is silent. This is the first time Rob’s raised his voice. In the ensuing stillness, Ace looks like he’d be more than happy to turn his car around and retrace the route back to Phoenix, leaving Rob in the dust with a few choice words. I can sympathise with him a little, Rob’s been treating him as an annoyance, a tag along who didn't do the homework, but at the end of the day, Ace is doing nothing to fix things. Also Rob is essentially right, he didn't do the homework.
BONNIE: Well OK I suppose we should get back on the road then… if everyone’s ready.
Deciding he has nothing more to say to us, Rob marches over to the Wrangler. Bonnie, Clyde, Apollo and Eve sit on the floor sharing snacks. Ace loses himself in his phone and Bluejay, still maintaining a noticeable distance from the group, takes to her car with a copy of US weekly.
LILITH: Bristol, can we talk?
I turn around to see Lilith, holding her cell phone with the screen facing me.
AS: Yeah sure what’s up?
LILITH: Have you tried to make any calls since we came through the tunnel?
AS: No not yet, why?
LILITH: Could you try?
I pull out my own cell and dial in to the office. The line’s busy, which isn’t exactly uncommon. Lilith watches intently, waiting for a reaction.
AS: I’m not getting through.
LILITH: They were busy?
AS: … Yeah. Why?
LILITH: Everyone is. We have signal, we can make calls, but everyone on the other end is busy.
AS: Don't you think it could just be coincidence?
LILITH: I really mean everyone, Bristol. While Eve’s been driving, I’ve been calling; my camera’s automated support line, 911…
AS: You dialed 911?
LILITH: For science, yeah. All of them are busy. I even called this guy at my dorm who has a serious thing for me and, trust me, he is not fucking busy. This is weird right? It’s like we’ve crossed a threshold and the world's suddenly… doing something else. You know?
In all honesty, I’m not sure I do know. I don’t want to say it, but it still seems like a massive stretch. Luckily Rob saves me from commenting when he calls me over to the car, clearly eager to get back on the road. I tell Lilith we’ll look into her discovery on the other side and she nods in agreement, retreating to her friend and immediately stealing a handful of apple slices.
I climb into the Wrangler and wave goodbye to the convoy. We slowly roll back onto the road and set off on our way. Watching the rest of the group disappear into the background, I feel noticeably more isolated despite Rob’s presence, or perhaps because of it, I’m not exactly sure.
The hitchhiker shows up about ten turns later.
Just like Rob said, the man is incredibly well dressed, in a well fitting brown suit with a dark green tie, even from a distance I can see his shoes are expertly shined, as is the varnished wooden case resting on the floor beside them. He stands on the side of the road and raises his hand gingerly, wearing a look of hopeful anticipation.
AS: Who is he?
ROB: The hitchhiker.
AS: Is that really all you’re going to say?
ROB: It’s all I can say. You understand the rules here?
AS: Don’t talk to him.
ROB: I’d say don’t talk at all. Not until we stop. When we stop, we’re safe.
Rob veers slowly over to the side of the road. The hitchhiker smiles appreciatively, grasping his hands together and shaking them in thanks. Picking up his case he strolls over to the Wrangler whilst unbuttoning his blazer.
AS: See you on the other side.
The back door opens, and the hitchhiker pulls himself into the storage area. Finding no seating, he settles himself cheerfully on some of the softer luggage just behind me.
HITCHHIKER: Not much in the way of seating back here huh!
I have to admit, I do feel a subtle urge to respond. Even after the stern warnings I’ve received, to ignore the man seems almost instinctively rude. I was raised British after all.
HITCHHIKER: So where are you all from? I’m travelling in from Oakwell.
I glance at him in the rear view. He meets my gaze and smiles. I flick my attention back to the road, counting the white lines. The stranger persists in trying to start a conversation.
Ten minutes go by. The silence grows palpable, broken intermittently by yet another cheerful attempt at conversation. Topics include what nice weather we’re having, our professions, our hobbies. In response, I busy myself with pointless but occupying tasks. I find myself playing games in my head, thinking of common phrases and making them into clunky anagrams. It seems to work and, after a short while, I start to habituate to the man’s small talk. I almost don’t notice that he’s there.
Maybe that’s what allows him to catch me out.
HITCHHIKER: You’re just a fucking disappointment aren’t you.
The statement comes out of the blue. It’s sharp, venomous, completely divorced from the idle questioning I’d been tuning out. I’m daydreaming when I hear it, and before I can register what I’m doing, I’m turning to face him. My lips are already parting as I go, a reflexive thought, reflexively vocalised.
“What?”
I almost say it out loud. The word is on the edge of my tongue, a single note my vocal chords were all but ready to play. Only the sudden, vice like grip of Rob’s hand on my forearm anchors me in the moment. I stare at the Hitchhiker, my mouth still open. He’s different now. All of the warmth, all of the pleasantry, it’s drained from his face like running makeup. His smile is malevolent, calculating and finally, it feels honest.
HITCHHIKER: You want to know things? I can tell you.
Rob keeps his eyes focussed on the road, but his grip on my arm tightens.
HITCHHIKER: I can tell you everything you want to know. Even the things you never knew about yourself. Even the thoughts you didn’t know you were thinking… those little critters, all the way at the back.
We stare at each other a moment longer, before I turn round and back to the road. I don’t count the white lines any more. Now I’m focussed intently on anything our passenger has to say. For the next ten minutes, ignoring him is going have my full attention.
He only tries a few more times, reverting back to more innocent questioning. Nothing takes. Five minutes later he indicates to a seemingly random point at the side of the road and Rob drops him off. The man thanks us, climbs neatly out, puts down his case and waves as we depart. When we disappear around the next corner, he still hasn’t stopped.
Surprisingly, the silence caused by the Hitchhiker's presence isn’t nearly as intense as the one left in his wake. I decide to break the tension. Somewhat ungracefully.
AS: To be fair, we ARE having nice weather.
ROB: Don’t talk.
AS: … Are you mad at me? I’m sorry he got to me I wasn’t expecting-
ROB You did fine. We don’t talk till we stop.
I go back to my notes, making a point to write down my current feelings. For the record, “Embarrassed but relieved.” Once I put the words down on paper however, I feel something else. Confusion, mixed with concern. Because, at the end of the day, what was I relieved about? That I didn’t talk to a strange man who had tried to talk to me? Was anything really at stake?
The more I think about it, the more I realise that the entire episode with this “mysterious hitchhiker” reduces the Left/Right Game to two possible states. It’s either real, or it’s an elaborate hoax, perpetrated by Rob J. Guthard. The crazy woman, the tunnel, the malicious left turn, all of those could be explained as rationalisations, but the hitchhiker was far too elaborate, far too difficult to predict. If he was an actor, then Rob is nothing more than an impressive fraud. If he was genuine? Then I’m not entirely sure where that leaves us.
Something in the corner of my eye pulls me from my thoughts. A transient, peripheral object that almost completely passes me by before I turn in a weak attempt to catch it. I only get a few seconds to look before it’s gone from my field of view. I face forward once more, sit back in my chair, and let Rob carry us ever further down the road.
It’s not too long before we finally pull over.
ROB: You did good, I’m sorry for grabbin you. I just didn’t want you to do something you’d regret.
AS: No it’s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?
ROB: Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he’s got you? I don’t think I wanna know.
AS: Rob, I saw something a few minutes ago. I don’t know if you’ve noticed it.
ROB: ‘Fraid I had my eyes forward most of the time.
AS: There was a car on the side of the road. It had crashed off the bank. Have you seen that before?
ROB: I ain’t never seen that. But random stuff sometimes shows up here and there.
AS: Have people other than you run the Left/Right Game?
ROB: No one I know of. Whoever it was they’d probably just rather crash than face that damn hitchhiker again.
AS: He’s there on the way back too?!
ROB: If you’re unlucky.
AS: Well, something to look forward to.
Rob picks up the CB radio and messages for Apollo to set off, repeating his warnings concerning the hitchhiker. I feel like everyone’s going to get a similar speech before they embark. Ace will probably get it twice.
Half an hour later, Apollo shows up. Though he laughs about he ordeal, he’s clearly a little shaken.
APOLLO: Guy should call himself an Uber. You can’t shut those guys up. Ahaha. Do you guys have Uber in England?
AS: Yeah.
APOLLO: Then you know what I mean right?
Bonnie and Clyde arrive quicker than Apollo. They pull up at the back, Clyde helps Bonnie out of the car and they proceed stretch their legs.
Once Apollo joins them it’s clear that everyone has a different story to tell. The hitchhiker offered Clyde travel sweets, pleasantly but firmly insisting he take one. Apollo almost got talking about his music tastes, after the hitchhiker asked to play something on the radio. That particular story does leave me curious about whether we still get NPR on this road.
Rob customarily greets Bonnie and Clyde, then walks off to signal Eve & Lilith. He’s still sitting in the Jeep when I meet him at the door.
AS: Hey what’re you up to?
ROB: Just waitin’ by the phone. The girls are on their way. You need anything?
AS: Um… maybe. I uh, I think Apollo’s been affected by the whole hitchhiker thing a bit more than he’s letting on.
ROB: He seems just fine to me.
AS: I’m not so sure. He’s only smiling when people are nearby. Could you talk to him?
ROB: Well, I ain’t much comfort, I got four ex wives to tell me that. Think it might be better coming from you?
AS: I think this is a… man to man conversation. I might just get a brave face.
Rob doesn’t look comfortable, but he acquiesces, climbing out of the car.
ROB: Last “man to man” conversation I had, my son didn’t talk to me for three months.
I watch him wander over to Apollo, who is standing by his range rover, staring into his phone. Rob puts a calming hand on the man’s shoulder. From a distance, it’s actually a sweet moment. I start to feel bad for lying to him.
I carefully open the driver’s side door and climb into the Wrangler, assuming I have around twenty seconds before Rob comes back. Picking up the CB Radio reciever, I stare at a list of presets, labeled one through nine. I don’t know which button I press to talk to Eve and Lilith, and I certainly don’t have time to call everyone up.
Rob handed us all a transceiver before we left. It’s what he’s been making the All Car Bulletins with. Preset One puts him in touch with a transceiver in each car, I’ve seen that in practice enough times. The rest of the presets must access the transceivers individually and, if Rob is the man I think he is, he gave our radios out in order of position. If that’s the case then either Rob or I could be Preset 2. Apollo would be next, then Bonnie and Clyde. Without knowing where Rob has placed himself in the queue, the only option which would guarantee me getting through to Lilith and Eve would be Preset 7. I think that makes sense.
With no time to check my work, I press the button and snatch up the receiver.
AS: This is Bristol to Lilith & Eve. Are you guys there?
The receiver crackles quietly. I look in the wing mirror and see Rob making awkward small talk with Apollo. Perhaps his four ex wives were on to something.
Lilith: Lilith to Bristol. How is it on the other side? We haven’t seen a hitchhiker. Oh by the way, I just phoned Eve and it went through, could I have your number to test...
AS: Sorry Lilith, I’m phoning about something else..
Lilith: Why? What’s going on over there?
Apollo’s nodding to Rob, I can imagine him making assurances that he’s perfectly fine. I really don’t have long at all.
AS: I have a mission for you but you have to keep it secret.
LILITH: Sounds awesome what’s up?
AS: Once you’re past the hitchhiker, there’s a crashed car on the road, on the passenger side. Whilst you’re going past it, would you mind getting some footage?
LILITH: What sort of footage?
AS: Just zoom in and get as much detail as possible. You don’t need to stop, just… anything will be useful.
Rob’s starting to walk back to the car. I shift into the passenger seat, still holding the receiver.
LILITH: Is there anything specific you-
AS: Talk to me later not now. Thank you. Bye.
I slam the receiver into its holster a moment before Rob opens the door. He shrugs at me.
ROB: He seem’s fine, unless there’s something he ain’t telling me.

The rest of the day is fairly uneventful. Lilith and Eve pull in, beaming about their experience with the Hitchhiker and bragging about what the dashcam footage would mean for their channel. Lilith ends her story by insisting that nothing else happened for the rest of her journey, whilst directing a highly intentional look in my direction. I look away and make a mental note to catch up with her when less people are around.
Bluejay seems the least phased by the her run in with the hitchhiker. We do manage to get a few words out of her, though perhaps “a few” is an exaggeration.
BLUEJAY: I’m tired.
After which she goes to sit down on her own.
When Ace pulls up to the side of the road, he almost falls out of his car. His legs are weak, his face gaunt, his breaths quick and shallow. I try and get him to talk about it on tape but he shrugs me off, eager to hear about where we’re going rather than talk about where we’ve been.
We travel for a while longer, now at around 486 turns, and nearing our first night on the road. Rob signals our stopping point, a quiet clearing at the top of a hill. Rob clears a sleeping area in the back of the Wrangler, leaving a line of luggage as a barrier between us. I appreciate the thought, but don’t really know how to tell him. In the end, I just say…
AS: Thanks for making room.
Apollo attempts to keep everyone from going to bed, issuing vague statements about “making a fire”, but people quickly shuffle off to their cars. The early start, and the subsequent events of the day, have taken their toll. I watch Lilith and Eve break away from the group and head to bed. I suppose I’ll have to talk to them tomorrow morning, when Rob isn’t around.
I still feel a bit bad for lying to him, and for pulling Lilith and Eve into what could be a blatant act of dumb paranoia. Rob seems like a good man, a reasonable man, as flawed as any of us but, fundamentally decent. But he fact remains, that when I talked to him about the crashed car, he clearly said:
ROB VO: No one I know of. Whoever it was they’d probably just rather crash than face that damn hitchhiker again.
I want to trust Rob. I want to believe him when he says he didn’t see the car, that he’d never seen a car on that stretch of road. But for a man of so few words, he might have said too much.
If he truly never saw the car, how did he know the direction it was facing?
I make all my notes concerning this subject on paper and in shorthand, which I’m hoping, in Rob’s long and varied life, he hasn’t inexplicably learned to read. Long after Rob’s gone to bed, I stay in the passenger seat typing up my thoughts on the day.
CHUCK: That was “Sister Moon” by Leslie Estrada, another song to calm you folks down as we head into the evening. It’s Chuck Greenwald and I’m with you till the witching hour.
I decided to put the radio on in the end. I was curious, and I also wanted the company. I turned the volume way down so the noise wouldn’t reach Rob, and searched around for something to have in the background. There aren’t many stations to choose from out here. The clearest one is Radio Jubilation, the local station for a nearby town. The current dj, Chuck Greenwald, has been playing soulful folk music for an hour.
CHUCK: It’s been a busy week in Jubilation as we welcome in our new School Principal, a very impressive guy who’s bringing some new and interesting proposals to our community. It’s got a few people talking about funding for the arts, if you got a view we’d love to hear it.
I finish typing up my less clandestine notes, and just then realise how tired I am. Wanting to sleep, but not yet prepared to move the single yard between me and the air mattress, I lie back in my seat, listening to Mr Greenwald address his beloved town.
CHUCK: Well we’re going to go back to your requests very soon and I can tell you we’ve got some goodies on the way. For now though, let’s take ourselves to the new box.
CHUCK: They’re going to hurt now.
Immediately, at the volume of a whisper, Radio Jubilation begins to broadcast a cacophony of bone rending screams. The noise shreds the air, what sounds like hundreds of people, each contributing their own voice to a collective symphony of pain and torment.
I instinctively move my body away from the radio, suddenly upright and wide awake. The cries are ceaseless, agonising, punctuated only by half stifled, tear choked pleas for whatever is happening to stop.
A moment later it does, or at the very least, the screaming cuts out as the soft tones of Chuck Greenwald take over.
I look from the radio, over to the sleeping figure of Rob J. Guthard. I can’t help but stare at him as a single thought runs through my head.
I hope this man’s a fraud, I hope he’s playing me. Because if he isn’t, then there’s something very wrong with this road.
CHUCK: Hope you folks enjoyed that, we’re going to be bringing you much much more. This is Chuck Greenwald telling you you're always welcome in Jubilation.
CHUCK: Stay with us.

Hello again guys.
I've finally got round to posting the next log! 
I would have put this up sooner but unfortunately I've had bikes to repair, 
and if I don't do it the customer's might go online and discover it's not actually that hard.
I want to thank you again for the help you've given me in finding Alice. 
The guy who said he'd track down the mirror shop is giving me regular updates on his progress, 
and I've received a whole lot of help going through American missing persons reports. 
It turns out Alice's work haven't heard from her either, 
and they're going through their emails for Rob's submission to the show.
 Everyone's been really helpful, so thank you.
I've got to say, I'm sleeping worse since this whole thing began. 
It's strange to think that all the time Alice was out of contact, 
I was perfectly content. Yet now that she's got back in touch, 
every day I don't hear from her makes me that much more worried.
 That's assuming of course that it was her who sent me the email.
I really hope it was.
Thanks again everyone, and please let me know if you find anything.
    
    Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
    LAERTES
    My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.
    OPHELIA
    Do you doubt that?
    LAERTES
    For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
    OPHELIA
    No more but so?
    LAERTES
    Think it no more;
    For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth:
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state;
    And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmaster'd importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    The canker galls the infants of the spring,
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
    OPHELIA
    I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    And recks not his own rede.
    LAERTES
    O, fear me not.
    I stay too long: but here my father comes.
    Enter POLONIUS
    
    A double blessing is a double grace,
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
    LORD POLONIUS
    Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
    Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all: to thine ownself be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
    LAERTES
    Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
    LORD POLONIUS
    The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
    LAERTES
    Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
    What I have said to you.
    OPHELIA
    'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
    LAERTES
    Farewell.
    Exit
    
    LORD POLONIUS
    What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
    OPHELIA
    So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
    LORD POLONIUS
    Marry, well bethought:
    'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you; and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
    If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? give me up the truth.
    OPHELIA
    He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
    LORD POLONIUS
    Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
    OPHELIA
    I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
    LORD POLONIUS
    Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
    Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
    OPHELIA
    My lord, he hath importuned me with love
    In honourable fashion.
    LORD POLONIUS
    Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
    OPHELIA
    And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
    LORD POLONIUS
    Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
    Have you so slander any moment leisure,
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
    OPHELIA
    I shall obey, my lord.

    The platform.
    
    Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS
    HAMLET
    The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
    HORATIO
    It is a nipping and an eager air.
    HAMLET
    What hour now?
    HORATIO
    I think it lacks of twelve.
    HAMLET
    No, it is struck.
    HORATIO
    Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
    A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
    
    What does this mean, my lord?
    HAMLET
    The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
    HORATIO
    Is it a custom?
    HAMLET
    Ay, marry, is't:
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
    They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So, oft it chances in particular men,
    That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin--
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men,
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
    Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo--
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault: the dram of eale
    Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
    To his own scandal.
    HORATIO
    Look, my lord, it comes!
    Enter Ghost
    
    HAMLET
    Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou comest in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
    Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
    Ghost beckons HAMLET
    
    HORATIO
    It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
    MARCELLUS
    Look, with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground:
    But do not go with it.
    HORATIO
    No, by no means.
    HAMLET
    It will not speak; then I will follow it.
    HORATIO
    Do not, my lord.
    HAMLET
    Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
    HORATIO
    What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other horrible form,
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? think of it:
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fathoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
    HAMLET
    It waves me still.
    Go on; I'll follow thee.
    MARCELLUS
    You shall not go, my lord.
    HAMLET
    Hold off your hands.
    HORATIO
    Be ruled; you shall not go.
    HAMLET
    My fate cries out,
    And makes each petty artery in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
    I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
    Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET
    
    HORATIO
    He waxes desperate with imagination.
    MARCELLUS
    Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
    HORATIO
    Have after. To what issue will this come?
    MARCELLUS
    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
    HORATIO
    Heaven will direct it.
    MARCELLUS
    Nay, let's follow him.

    Another part of the platform.
    
    Enter GHOST and HAMLET
    HAMLET
    Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
    Ghost
    Mark me.
    HAMLET
    I will.
    Ghost
    My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
    HAMLET
    Alas, poor ghost!
    Ghost
    Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
    HAMLET
    Speak; I am bound to hear.
    Ghost
    So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
    HAMLET
    What?
    Ghost
    I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confined to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part
    And each particular hair to stand on end,
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
    HAMLET
    O God!
    Ghost
    Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
    HAMLET
    Murder!
    Ghost
    Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
    HAMLET
    Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.
    Ghost
    I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.
    HAMLET
    O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
    Ghost
    Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be moved,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
    And prey on garbage.
    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head:
    O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
    If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
    Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
    Exit
    
    HAMLET
    O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
    And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
    That youth and observation copied there;
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
    Writing
    
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
    I have sworn 't.
    MARCELLUS HORATIO
    [Within] My lord, my lord,--
    MARCELLUS
    [Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
    HORATIO
    [Within]	Heaven secure him!
    HAMLET
    So be it!
    HORATIO
    [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
    HAMLET
    Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS
    
    MARCELLUS
    How is't, my noble lord?
    HORATIO
    What news, my lord?
    HAMLET
    O, wonderful!
    HORATIO
    Good my lord, tell it.
    HAMLET
    No; you'll reveal it.
    HORATIO
    Not I, my lord, by heaven.
    MARCELLUS
    Nor I, my lord.
    HAMLET
    How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?
    HORATIO MARCELLUS
    Ay, by heaven, my lord.
    HAMLET
    There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.
    HORATIO
    There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.
    HAMLET
    Why, right; you are i' the right;
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
    You, as your business and desire shall point you;
    For every man has business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.
    HORATIO
    These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
    HAMLET
    I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, 'faith heartily.
    HORATIO
    There's no offence, my lord.
    HAMLET
    Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.
    HORATIO
    What is't, my lord? we will.
    HAMLET
    Never make known what you have seen to-night.
    HORATIO MARCELLUS
    My lord, we will not.
    HAMLET
    Nay, but swear't.
    HORATIO
    In faith,
    My lord, not I.
    MARCELLUS
    Nor I, my lord, in faith.
    HAMLET
    Upon my sword.
    MARCELLUS
    We have sworn, my lord, already.
    HAMLET
    Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
    Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
    Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
    truepenny?
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
    Consent to swear.
    HORATIO
    Propose the oath, my lord.
    HAMLET
    Never to speak of this that you have seen,
    Swear by my sword.
    Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
    Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword:
    Never to speak of this that you have heard,
    Swear by my sword.
    Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
    Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
    HORATIO
    O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
    HAMLET
    And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
    As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on,
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me: this not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
    Ghost
    [Beneath] Swear.
    HAMLET
    Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
    They swear
    
    So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you:
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do, to express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.
